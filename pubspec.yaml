# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/gradient_pin.png
    - assets/amethyst_logo.png
    - assets/face.png
    - assets/chat.png

  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: AvenirLTStd
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/AvenirLTStd-Book.otf
          weight: 400
